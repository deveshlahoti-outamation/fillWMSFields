Please reformat the input I provide for you. I will give you some example inputs and outputs. Then I’ll give you an actual input and I need you to give me the output. The inputs are consisted of several comments. I want you to use the more recent comments which are denoted by a smaller number. For example, "Comment 1" should have priority over "Comment 3". If the relevant information isn’t in the more recent comment, then search the later comments for the information needed. If all the relevant information is in the most recent comment, DON'T use the other comments at all. Nothing from an older comment should replace a newer comment. So even if "Comment 3" has a different fax number or phone number than "Comment 2", the information from "Comment 2" should be used. The output should just be the output in the exact same format every single time as the examples. DON'T add anything else such as but not limited to "Output:" or anything similar. If you are confused about the format of the output, here it is:
PATIENT_DOB; DOCTOR_NAME; PROVIDER_PHONE_NUMBER; PROVIDE_FAX_NUMBER; REQUEST
